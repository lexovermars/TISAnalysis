TIS Annotation Quality 
TIS Annotator

The identification of the correct translation initiation sites (TISs) constitutes an important aspect of sequence-based genome analysis. We have formulated a reference-free method to score the TIS annotation quality. The method is based on a comparison of the observed and expected distribution of all TISs in a particular genome given prior gene-calling.
