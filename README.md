TIS Analysis
===========


The identification of the correct translation initiation sites (TISs) constitutes an important aspect of sequence-based genome analysis. We have formulated a reference-free method to score the TIS annotation quality. The method is based on a comparison of the observed and expected distribution of all TISs in a particular genome given prior gene-calling. 

Requirements
--------------
The following non-default python packages
- NumPy
- SciPy
- matplotlib

R is required for the PCA-based correction of TIS existing annotations.
